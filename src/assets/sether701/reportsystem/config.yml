# Welcome to the configuration file of Sether's Reportsystem
# Here you can edit a few settings like prefix and plugin-mode
# Above each variable is a little explanation

# As the name already reveals 'prefix' is the prefix at the beginning of plugin messages
prefix: &7[&4Report&7]

# 'mode' is the plugin-mode you want to use
# If the mode is 'none' the plugin doesn't even start
# The mode 'custom' allows user to write their own reasons for their report
# The mode 'list' allows the admin to choose some reasons and put them in a list
# Then players have to choose one of them by writing its ID
# The mode 'gui' also allows the admin to choose some reasons
# but in this case, they are presented by items in a GUI (Graphical User Interface) / Inventory
mode: none
